# We are now employing a git-submodule-like policy for synchronizing the
# upstream components.  That is, all changes to the upstream modules in
# the mupen64plus-ae repository must be made on the upstream side first,
# then pulled downstream using this script.  Any manual modifications made
# from the downstream side will be overwritten the next time this script
# is run.  That is very much intentional, as it enforces the top-down
# philosophy we are now adopting.
# 
# Developers may still manually modify the upstream modules from the down-
# stream side, as long as they do it in a branch that never gets merged
# back to master.  That is also very much intentional; it should still be
# easy for devs to experiment with upstream code while working in the
# downstream project.
# 
# Note that we are not actually using git-submodule, due to its infamous
# fragility.  We do not want to require our contributors to be git super-
# users.
# 
# The approach used here is much more robust than git-submodule, since the
# upstream code is always retained in the downstream repository's history.
# The approach used here simply emulates what a git superuser would do
# using only basic git and shell operations.  That means that any mistakes
# created by this commit can be fixed using basic git and shell commands.
# No black magic or human sacrifices are needed in a worst-case scenario.
