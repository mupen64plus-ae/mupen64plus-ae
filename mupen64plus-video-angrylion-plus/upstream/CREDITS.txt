This little RDP plugin was initially based on MESS 0.128 source code.
Many thanks to Ville Linde, MooglyGuy and other people who wrote the RDP implementation in MESS 0.128. The rest of the code is by me, angrylion.
Many thanks to people who helped me in various ways: olivieryuyu, marshallh, LaC, oman, pinchy, ziggy, FatCat, LegendOfDragoon and other folks I forgot.
The code comes under MAME license.
Sorry for my terrible English.
